**Abstract—** Software testability is the propensity of software artifact to reveal its existing defects. Software requirements are crucial artifacts in developing software. Requirements specifications are used in both the functional and acceptance testing to ensure that a program meets its requirements. A testable requirement increases the effectiveness of testing while decreasing the cost and time. In this paper, we define requirement testability in terms of requirements smells and propose a measuring method. 
  
**Index Terms:** Software requirement, requirement testability, requirement smells, expert system

## 1 Introduction

The achievement of the quality of software requirements is the first step towards software quality. Natural language is the main representation means of industrial requirements documents, which implies that requirements documents are inherently ambiguous. A Requirements Smell is an indicator of a  quality violation, which may lead to a defect, with a concrete location and a concrete detection mechanism.
Unfortunately, there is no publicly available tool and benchmark to detect requirement smells and measure the requirements quality. ARTA is a research project at [IUST Reverse Engineering Laboratory](http://reverse.iust.ac.ir/) aimed at detecting requirement smells and measuring requirement testability in all kinds of requirements expressed in natural languages.
